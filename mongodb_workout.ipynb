       "    'comments': \"This is my second time staying at Greta's apartment. The best place to stay in NYC by far. There is a subway on the same street as the apartment, a two minute walk away (the 1 line) and multiple places to eat close by. There is also a CVS , Walgreens, grocery and liquor store within walking distance as well. The apartment is very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Checking in and out as easy as Greta is very flexible. The apartment is very spacious with a nice kitchen and lots of room in the fridge. I hope to continue to stay here every time I visit New York! \"},\n",

On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport. Once again Greta allowed us to arrive and leave at times that suited us with our luggage which didn't leave us stranded for hours with difficult flight times from Australia which was a great relief, thanks so much Greta!\"},\n",

The apartment is near of Central Park and a lot of stores and restaurants. It’s a calm local neighborhood, to live your days in the city like a real new yorker :) . The place was very clean, the shower was good and beds was confortable. The heater sistem worked very well and kept us warm always - it was very important, because the temperatures was very low during our stay there. We definetelly recomend this place to stay! '},\n",

Great neighborhood - many terrific restaurants, bakeries, bagelries. Within easy walking distance are restaurants with the cuisines from India, Thailand, Japan, China, Mexico, South America and Europe.  As well as the many small independent stores that line Broadway, there chain stores such as Urban Outfitters (clothing), Whole Foods (groceries), Sephora (cosmetics), Michaels (crafts), and Modell's (sporting goods). Equidistant to Central Park and Riverside Park which have walking/running/biking trails as well as tennis and racquet ball courts. 10-15 blocks from Columbia University between Broadway and Amsterdam. The International Hostel across the street is an airport shuttle bus and double-decker tour bus stop.

I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\\r\\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\\r\\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would totally stay here again.  \"},\n",

Her apt is located close to all amenities, Central and Riverside Parks, and bus/subway stops. The apt is clean, more spacious than expected, well stocked with anything you could possibly need, and has very comfortable beds and a first rate shower. I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom! This is not fancy accommodation but warm and homey and probably a good representation of how an average New Yorker lives, although I suspect not many are as organized as Greta.

Birds singing in the trees outside, comfy beds, loads of restaurants and grocery nearby. Lovely easy walks to Central Park, Riverside Park. Subway stop right on the corner. We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. \"},\n",

I would describe the apartment as a very warm, personal, comfortable and homey place to stay. It’s a corner apartment with good light, lots of books and  very good energy. Plus, the beds are quite comfortable. My daughter exclaimed “Hey Dad, come lie down in this one. You’ll never want to get up!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood was incredibly well located and enjoyable. The train stops  a half block away, and there are numerous excellent restaurants and conveniences close by. Greta, the host, provides a first-rate list of recommendations.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreta was a personable, helpful and extremely welcoming host. She was very quick to respond to my online inquiries and, once we arrived, to any further requests for advice.\\r\\n'},\n",

The house is charming and comfortable, and very conveniently located right by the 1 train. We were two of us and only used one room, but the house can fit another person or two. \\r\\nFor anyone visiting NYC and looking to be in the city but not in the midst of the city noise, this is a great place to stay! You can be downtown in 20 minutes. '},\n",

The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!\"},\n",

I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\\r\\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\\r\\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would totally stay here again.  \"},\n",

Her apt is located close to all amenities, Central and Riverside Parks, and bus/subway stops. The apt is clean, more spacious than expected, well stocked with anything you could possibly need, and has very comfortable beds and a first rate shower. I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom! This is not fancy accommodation but warm and homey and probably a good representation of how an average New Yorker lives, although I suspect not many are as organized as Greta.

Birds singing in the trees outside, comfy beds, loads of restaurants and grocery nearby. Lovely easy walks to Central Park, Riverside Park. Subway stop right on the corner. We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. \"},\n",
